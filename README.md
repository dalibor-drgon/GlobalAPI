 GlobalAPI
===========

Old library implemented for (my own) educational purposes. Development started 2014 while the code was passively cleaned and corrected until early 2017. Implements experimental HTTP/1.1 server, a simple database with binary serializer, and utilities for work with I/O, sockets, strings, and collections.
